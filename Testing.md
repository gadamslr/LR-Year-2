#Testing
There are **8 marks** available for this section.

##Introduction

In this section you do not have to be too extensive in your testing so it is advised that you select a sample of tests that shows how your solution meets your objectives, as set in the analysis stage of your project. 

The sample of tests should include the more complex algorithms, basically work through the more interesting parts of your project work demonstrating its robustness. If any of these parts do not work as expected then explain what you have discovered through your testing. 


To do this you will need to include:

- an introduction and overview to the tests you have carried out
- Idenitfy your core objectives have been met.
	- These should include the more complex parts or your project.
- should provide and present in a structured way for example **in tabular form**, clear evidence of testing. 
	- the test performed
	- its purpose if not self-evident
	- the test data
	- the expected test outcome
	- the actual outcome with a sample of the evidence, for example screen shots of before and after the test, etc, sampled in order to limit volume.

# Scenario Testing
It is advised that you create a test scenario based on your users needs. This is where you can test the whole system from start to finish, showing how the system works and highlighting errors if any arise.

# User testing
Include a description about tests carried out by your user(s) or customers.
Add details about any errors or suggested changes by the user.

The **user testing** can also be carried out by someone in the class.

***Remember -*** It doesnâ€™t matter if the project fails!!!!!
- You just need to explain why this has failed.



###Highlighting changes
During the implementation phase you may have changed some aspects of your design therefore it may be necessary to modify your testing plan. If so, make the changes but be sure to explain and justify any variations from the original plan.

You should clearly justify any additions or removals from your plan and ensure that they are easily **identifiable** from the original plan. 

##Database testing
include the testing of  **normal, erroneous and extreme** data into your system .

For each data set you should also describe the type of data set it is and explain why it is a good choice for the given test.


#Testing section grading

|	Level	|	Mark range	|	Description	|
|-----|-----|-----|
|	4	|	7-8	|	Clear evidence, in the form of carefully selected representative samples, that thorough testing has been carried out. This demonstrates the robustness of the complete or nearly complete solution/thoroughness of investigation and that the requirements of the solution/investigation have been achieved.	|
|	3	|	5-6 |	Extensive testing has been carried out, but the evidence presented in the form of representative samples does not make clear that all of the core requirements of the solution/investigation have been achieved. This may be due to some key aspects not being tested or because the evidence is not always presented clearly.	|
|	2	|	3-4	|	"Evidence in the form of representative samples of moderately extensive testing, but falling short of demonstrating that the requirements of the solution/investigation have been achieved and the solution is robust/investigation thorough. - The evidence presented is explained."	|
|	1	|	1-2	|	A small number of tests have been carried out, which demonstrate that some parts of the solution work/some outcomes of the investigation are achieved. The evidence presented may not be entirely clear.
